## About RIBs
- [incorporate problems here, maybe merge 1, 2, 3, 4]
- [1] Our approach
        ?? Unopinionated
        ?? Plugins-based
        ?? State persistence
        ?? Transitions
- [2] Your application as a tree 
- [3] Divide & conquer
- [4] Tree structure (Node, parent, child, sibling)
  - Complexity
  - DI
  - Testing in isolation
  - Reuse

## Setup

- [Module deps](setup/deps.md)
- [Integration point](setup/integrationpoint.md)

## Basics
- [Terminology](basics/terminology.md)
- [Nodes in detail](basics/nodes.md)
- [Plugins](basics/plugins.md)

## Hello world!
- [Hello world!](helloworld/helloworld.md)
- [Adding a view](helloworld/view.md)
- [Adding business logic]](helloworld/businesslogic.md)

## Tree structure 101

- [Routing](routing/routing.md)
- [Resolving routing](routing/resolving-routing.md)
- Back stack
- When the back stack is not enough
- Navigation
- Transitions
- Child builders & dependencies
- Communication between Nodes
    - when to handle locally / bubble up
- Deep link workflows
