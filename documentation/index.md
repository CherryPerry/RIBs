## Problems

- Problems with multiple Activities
- Problems with Fragments
- Problems with opinionated frameworks

## About RIBs
- [incorporate problems here, maybe merge 1, 2, 3, 4]
- [1] Our approach
        ?? Unopinionated
        ?? Plugins-based
        ?? State persistence
        ?? Transitions
- [2] Your application as a tree 
- [3] Divide & conquer
- [4] Tree structure (Node, parent, child, sibling)
  - Complexity
  - DI
  - Testing in isolation
  - Reuse
