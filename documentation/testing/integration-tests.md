# Integration tests

The framework also provides multiple ways of integration testing.

## Rib test

We can create an instance of `Node` (or `Rib`) with help of `Builder` in JUnit test and verify its behaviour quite fast without using any emulators.
To do so we need to use one of the framework features â€“ view factory replacement.
We can replace `View` implementation of `RIB` with stub implementation (as we did previously in `Interactor`) while keeping every other internal component intact.
`View` implementation can be unit tested separately.
To control the lifecycle of `Node` please use `RibNodeTestHelper`.

```kotlin
class SomeScreenNodeTest {

    // Test implementations of network and analytics components, that allows to stub results and verify calls 
    private val testTracker = TestAnalyticsTracker()
    private val testNetwork = TestNetwork()

    // We can replace view implementation with stub, so we can run this test without Robolectric
    // RibViewStub is suitable for MVI approach, but you can easily create your own View stub just by implementing View interface
    private val view = object : RibViewStub<SomeScreenView.ViewModel, SomeScreenView.Event>(), SomeScreenView {}

    // Create the node under test through builder, provide stub dependencies
    private val node = SomeScreenBuilder(
        dependency = object : SomeScreen.Dependency {
            override val network: Network = testNetwork
            override val analyticsTracker: AnalyticsTracker = testTracker
        }
    ).build(
        buildContext = BuildContext.root(
            savedInstanceState = null,
            // Override view implementation with stub
            customisations = SomeScreen.Customisation { { view } }.toDirectory()
        )
    )

    // RibNodeTestHelper will invoke all required callbacks to setup Node properly
    private val nodeTestHelper = RibNodeTestHelper(node)

    @Test
    fun `GIVEN not loading WHEN click button THEN display loading state`() {
        // Move Node to STARTED state
        nodeTestHelper.moveToStateAndCheck(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {

            // Fake user actions on UI
            view.viewEventRelay.accept(SomeScreenView.Event.ButtonPressed)

            // Assert that View received correct state to render
            assertThat(view.lastViewModel).isEqualTo(SomeScreenView.ViewModel(isLoading = true))
        }
    }

    @Test
    fun `GIVEN not loading WHEN input SomeInput THEN output SomeOutput`() {
        // Observe outputs
        val outputTest = node.output.test()

        nodeTestHelper.moveToStateAndCheck(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
            // Send some input
            node.input.accept(SomeScreen.Input.SomeInput)

            // Verify outputs
            outputTest.assertValue(SomeScreen.Output.SomeOutput)
        }
    }

}
```

In case when `Rib` has children, use the same approach as for `Interactor` and `Router` tests. 
We can replace child builders with stubs.
Create internal and visible for tests constructor and use it to replace child builders.

```kotlin
class SomeScreenBuilder @VisibleForTesting internal constructor(
    private val dependency: SomeScreen.Dependency,
    private val childBuilders: SomeScreenBuilders?
) : SimpleBuilder<SomeScreen>() {

    constructor(dependency: Tab1.Dependency) : this(
        dependency = dependency,
        childBuilders = null,
    )

    override fun build(buildParams: BuildParams<Nothing?>): SomeScreen {
        ...
        val router = SomeScreenRouter(
            buildParams = buildParams,
            routingSource = backStack,
            // Use real builders or provided by test ones
            builders = childBuilders ?: SomeScreenBuildersImpl(dependency)
        )
        ...
    }
```

Then use the same technique to create stubs and use them to verify inputs and to send outputs.

```kotlin
class SomeScreenNodeTest {

    ...

    // Use RibBuilderStub for testing purposes, RibNodeStub to create stub for Node
    private val child1Builder = RibBuilderStub<Child1Builder.Param, Child1> { params ->
        object : RibNodeStub<RibView>(params), Child1, Connectable<Child1.Input, Child1.Output> by NodeConnector()
    }    

    // Use internal testing constructor
    private val node = SomeScreenBuilder(
        dependency = object : SomeScreen.Dependency {
            override val network: Network = testNetwork
            override val analyticsTracker: AnalyticsTracker = testTracker
        },
        childBuilders = object : SomeScreenBuilders {
            override val child1 = child1Builder
        }
    ).build(
        buildContext = BuildContext.root(
            savedInstanceState = null,
            // Override view implementation with stub
            customisations = SomeScreen.Customisation { { view } }.toDirectory()
        )
    )

    ...

    @Test
    fun `GIVEN Child1 is attached WHEN Child1  THEN output SomeOutput`() {
        nodeTestHelper.moveToStateAndCheck(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
            val test = child1Builder.last?.input?.test()

            // Fake Child1 ouput
            child1Builder.last?.output?.accept(Child1.Output.SomeThing)

            // Verify Child1 input
            test.assertValue(Child1.Input.SomeThing)

            // Verify Child1 was dettached and destroyed
            child1Builder.assertLastNodeState(Lifecycle.State.DESTROYED)
        }
    }

}
```

## UI Tests

The framework also provides a way to write UI integration tests for `Node` implementation.
You can use `RibsRule` to write the same test as above, but with real view implementation.
You are free to use both fake and real children to test different levels of integration.
When you fake children, then use `RibBuilderStub` to send inputs and verify outputs.
When you use real children, then use `Espresso` and stubs to move both children and parent into desired state.

```kotlin
class SomeScreenTest {

    @get:Rule
    val ribsRule = RibsRule()

    // Send inputs to the Rib
    private val input = PublishRelay.create<EmptyScreen.Input>()
    // Verify outputs from the Rib
    private val output = PublishRelay.create<EmptyScreen.Output>()

    private fun buildRib(activity: RibTestActivity, bundle: Bundle?) =
        // We do not replace any children in this test, but you are free to do it
        SomeScreenBuilder(
            dependency = object : SomeScreen.Dependency {
                override val network: Network = ...
                override val analyticsTracker: AnalyticsTracker = ...
            },
        ).build(root(bundle)).also {
            // Wire inputs and outputs
            input.subscribe(it.input)
            it.output.subscribe(output)
        }

    @Before
    fun before() {
        ribsRule.start { activity, bundle -> buildRib(activity, bundle) }
    }

    @Test
    fun WHEN_press_refresh_button_THEN_send_SomeOuput() {
        val outputTest = output.test()

        onView(withId(R.id.title)).perform(click())

        outputTest.assertValue(SomeScreen.Output.SomeOutput)
    }

}
```

# Compatibility with other frameworks

We tried to make the testing suite decoupled from any testing framework (JUnit4/JUnit5/Kotest and etc.) and want to try to keep it so.
If you experience any incompatibility issues, feel free to create your own test helper classes based on our logic that suits your requirements.
You can share your experience in the issues section or propose a pull request to make it better.
