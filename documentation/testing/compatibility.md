# Compatibility with other frameworks

We tried to make the testing suite decoupled from any testing framework (JUnit4/JUnit5/Kotest and etc.) and want to try to keep it so.
If you experience any incompatibility issues, feel free to create your own test helper classes based on our logic that suits your requirements.
You can share your experience in the issues section or propose a pull request to make it better.
